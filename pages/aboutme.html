    <h1>About Me:</h1>
    <p>Hey, I’m Eren Yeager. Ever since I was a kid, I've been driven by a burning desire to see the world beyond the Walls and to fight for freedom. I grew up in a world confined and controlled by towering walls, but I always knew there was more out there. I’ve always been fiercely determined and a bit reckless, especially when it comes to protecting my friends and fighting Titans. My journey hasn’t been easy—filled with battles, losses, and hard truths—but it's all part of my quest to secure a future where humanity can truly be free. My friends, like Mikasa and Armin, mean everything to me, and I’ll do whatever it takes to ensure their safety and achieve our shared dreams. I hope to be free one day.</p>
